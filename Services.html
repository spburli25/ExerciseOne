			  <p> It stems from the belief that corporations are socio-economic citizens and that their objectives have to be congruent with society’s goals.
			      Today, they wield significant capacity to influence social issues, i.e. “power to do good”.
			      This is a responsibility and must manifest in thoughtful and deliberate set of initiatives, not in charity.
			      Wipro believes it must try to, and can make (some) lasting impact, towards creating a just, equitable, humane & sustainable society.
